Wave Particles with Interactive Vortices
========================

## Overview 

In game industry water can be divided into two domains: ocean and river. This project focuses on river. Not too long ago, a demo of [a real-time river editor](https://80.lv/articles/river-editor-water-simulation-in-real-time/) was developed by graphics programmer [Jean-Philippe Grenier](http://jpgrenier.org/) from Ubisoft. We think what he did is awesome and want to replicate it (as possible as we can).

Traditionally, rivers are rendered using flow maps. Flow maps are generated by fluid simulations or created by artist or even both. Flow maps are used for advection of water properties such as normal and uv. This technique can give the river a deterministic fluid look, but it fails to capture the sense of height compared with the less controlled ocean rendering techniques, which basically stack several noise functions together to generate the waves. Stacking noise functions together only works for ocean because the ocean does not flow. When you want the water both flow and have the sense of height, a new method should be used.

The new method is [Wave Particles](http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/waveparticles/waveparticles_sketch_slides.pdf). Initially, Wave Particles were introduced into game industry by [Naughty Dog for Uncharted 3](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015309/Water-Technology-of) to simulate local high frequency wave of oceans. Then it was adopted and adapted to render rivers by [Naughty Dog for Uncharted 4](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2016/s16_ramy_final.pptx) paired with stacking technique.

The significance of the Jean-Philippe Grenier's work is that it generates flow map in real-time. That is why the user can interactively create rocks to block the river and affect the flow of river as we can see in the video. When performing advection on height and normal, previous implementations from Naughty Dog or [Valve](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2010/Vlachos-Waterflow(SIGGRAPH%202010%20Advanced%20RealTime%20Rendering%20Course).pdf) use noise and blending techniques to minimize repetition and pulsing caused by advection of a finite sized texture. But in this demo the developer used a new technique called [Wave Profile Buffer](http://pub.ist.ac.at/group_wojtan/projects/2018_Jeschke_WaterSurfaceWavelets/WaterSurfaceWavelets.pdf) to solve the repetition and pulsing.
